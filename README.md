*Restoring Trust in Utility Services via Hedera Hashgraph*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Amanar Wuta (PowerTrust) is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the high-throughput, low-fee Hedera Hashgraph to fundamentally restore trust and ensure accountability between utility providers and consumers.

## ❌ The Problem
Traditional utility systems are plagued by:
- **Opaque transactions** and lack of verifiable complaint handling
- **Consumer distrust** due to lost, ignored, or disputed complaints
- **No cryptographic proof** of electricity purchases
- **Centralized, inefficient** logging systems

## ✅ The Solution
**Two-Pillar Approach on Hedera:**

1. **🔐 Proof of Payment** 
   - Tokenize electricity top-ups using Hedera Token Service (HTS)
   - Each token represents verified purchase with cryptographic proof

2. **📝 Immutable Complaint Logging**
   - Log all consumer complaints via Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)
   - Timestamped, tamper-proof records with supporting media
   - Public ledger of service issues for community accountability

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Hedera Token Service (HTS)** - Payment tokenization
- **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** - Immutable complaint logging
- **Hedera Smart Contracts** - Future automated resolution features
- **Web3 Integration** - User-friendly dApp interface
