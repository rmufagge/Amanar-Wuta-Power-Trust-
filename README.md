# 🔋 Amanar Wuta (PowerTrust)

*Restoring Trust in Utility Services via Hedera Hashgraph - Hedera Africa Hackathon Submission*

## 🎯 Project Overview
Amanar Wuta (PowerTrust) is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the high-throughput, low-fee Hedera Hashgraph to fundamentally restore trust and ensure accountability between utility providers and consumers.

## ❌ The Problem
Traditional utility systems suffer from:
- **Opaque transactions** and lack of verifiable complaint handling
- **Consumer distrust** due to lost, ignored, or disputed complaints  
- **No cryptographic proof** of electricity purchases
- **Centralized, inefficient** logging systems

## ✅ The Solution
**Transparent, Tamper-Proof Platform:**

### 1. 🔐 Proof of Payment via HTS
- Tokenize electricity top-ups using **Hedera Token Service (HTS)**
- Each token represents verified purchase with **irrefutable cryptographic proof**

### 2. 📝 Immutable Complaint Logging via HCS  
- Log all consumer complaints via **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)**
- **Timestamped, tamper-proof records** with supporting media

### 3. 👥 Community Accountability
- Publicly viewable complaint history
- **Verifiable ledger** of service issues

## 🛠 Technology Stack
- **Hedera Token Service (HTS)** - Payment tokenization
- **Hedera Consensus Service (HCS)** - Immutable complaint logging
- **Hedera Smart Contracts** - Future automated features
